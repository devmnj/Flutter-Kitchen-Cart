# Kitchen Cart

A Flutter - Firestore application that will run on Android and  iOS. Users can add item to the shopping cart and can mark items  as finished when purchase complete by *sliding item to right side* also can *remove item by sliding to left*. So the second user can see what shopper guy purchased for him and what else remain on his list. This is a simple live data example.

## IDE and  Packages

This project used `Android Studio` for coding and design and also utilized following flutter packages
